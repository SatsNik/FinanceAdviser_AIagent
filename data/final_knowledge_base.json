Now, you have huge expenses to meet simultaneously, and both the issues have the same priority. In this stressful time, a health insurance policy for your family can share your burden by paying for the transplant, and you can pay the fees of your daughter from your savings without any worry. In this way, general insurance in India works as your saviour."

The amount you have paid to repair your car can be reimbursed under a comprehensive car insurance policy. In this way, a general insurance policy for a car fulfils your requirement for financial help in case of car damage due to an accident."

Therefore, always look at what is covered and what is not covered to help evaluate the most valuable plan to you. \nSum Insured - Your Sum Insured in your Home Insurance refers to the total amount you’ll be covered for in the case of a claim you make. Therefore, be very wary on the amount you’d like to go for since this won’t only affect your home insurance premium but will also affect the claim amount you will receive in the case of damages and losses! \nAdd-ons Available - Sometimes, you need coverage beyond just the basic plan benefits.

        "General Insurance": "The global travel insurance market is expected to grow from $28.87 billion in 2024 to $94.66 billion by 2032, with a CAGR of 16%. This growth is driven by the post-pandemic tourism boom, increased traveler awareness, technological advancements, and mandatory insurance requirements. Key markets like the US, Germany, China, and the UK are experiencing significant growth. The single-trip insurance sector leads the market, and insurance firms dominate distribution channels. This expansion highlights the rising importance of travel insurance."

Many banks, under their special schemes and/or for specific tenures, offer an additional interest rate of 0.20% – 0.50% over and above their senior citizen FD rates. For instance,senior citizen FD ratesoffered on a tenure of 15 months to less than 18 months by ICICI Bank are 10 bps or 0.10% over and above the existing additional senior citizen FD rates of 50 bps. Furthermore, some banks and NBFCs also offer additional interest rates to super senior citizens (age 80 years and above). For instance, Indian Bank offers an additional interest rate of 0.75% p.a. to super senior citizens (FD depositors aged 80 years and above) for tenures of up to 5 years and 1% additional interest rate on deposits above 5 years to 10 years."

Late payment fee is usually a fixed charge based on the total outstanding amount on your card and will only be charged once in a billing cycle, whereas interest (also known as finance charges) is calculated as a percentage of the total due for as long as your dues remain unpaid. Also, when you have an overdue balance on your card, the interest-free period becomes invalid. This means your new transactions will start incurring interest charges from the first day. Since credit card interest rates are the highest among all credit products, even a small overdue can lead to a debt spiral and cause damage to your credit score."
