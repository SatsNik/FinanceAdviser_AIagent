health_insurance,main,"In simple terms, when you buy health insurance, you get a financial cover up to a certain amount for the medical expenses you may incur in a year. It covers emergency and planned expenses for hospitalisation, day-care treatments, surgeries, pre and post-hospitalisation, ambulance charges. Hence, a right health insurance policy helps you ward off unnecessary financial burden when a medical situation or emergency arises. Moreover, it also offers tax savings under Section 80D of the Income Tax, 1961 on the premium amount you pay to the insurer."

health_insurance,main,Health insurance coverage should be tailored to individual medical needs and circumstances. An ideal health insurance plan is usually suggested to have a sum insured equal to at least half of your annual income. You must check if it is sufficient to meet your medical expenses.Experts suggest buying a health cover of at least ₹10 lakhs to combat rising healthcare costs easily.
health_insurance,main,
health_insurance,main,
health_insurance,main,You must consider the following three factors to decide the ideal coverage for your health insurance plan:
health_insurance,main,"For instance, if you have no pre-existing diseases and live in a tier-3 city, where the living cost is less than in metropolitan areas, health insurance of ₹5 lakh may be enough to provide financial protection against medical expenses. Similarly, if you are residing in a tier-1 city where the living costs are high or have a critical illness, you may have to increase the coverage to ₹10 or 20 lakhs for better financial protection."
health_insurance,main,"To know your ideal medical insurance coverage amount, check out the table given below:"
health_insurance,main,"Alternatively, you can also opt for a ₹1 crore health insurance policy that has become extremely affordable these days. A ₹1 crore health policy can come in handy for treating a disease that requires long-term care or for medical procedures taken abroad.You can easily get a ₹1 crore health cover by paying an extra premium of approximately ₹1500."
health_insurance,main,You also have a more affordable option of purchasing a base health insurance policy with a low sum insured and buying a top-up cover with a high sum insured.

health_insurance,main,
health_insurance,main,All pre-existing diseases must be disclosed during policy purchase. Keeping it a secret may cause problems at the time of claim settlement and can even lead to rejection of your claims.
health_insurance,main,"Even if you are a smoker or an alcoholic, you must disclose it to the insurance company."

Here are some of the major advantages of comparing and buying a health insurance plan online:"
health_insurance,main,"Before buying a health insurance policy, you must be aware of how it works. Mentioned below are some popular myths that most people believe about health insurance:"
health_insurance,main,"Despite being healthy and taking good care of your health, there are numerous unforeseen circumstances, like seasonal illnesses, dengue, malaria, or an accident, that can hit anyone anytime. Nowadays, hospitalization expenses are not easy to pay off. Even 2 days of hospitalization in a tier 1 city would cost you somewhere between₹60,000 to₹1 lakh and even more (depending on the type of illness and hospital). With medical insurance, you can get financial assistance to pay for expensive hospitalization costs."
health_insurance,main,"As per the IRDAI regulations, all health insurance plans come with a set of exclusions/limitations. It is advised to check all the policy details and the coverage offered by your insurer. This is because your insurer will only compensate for the expenses that are covered in the policy and up to the sum insured limit."
health_insurance,main,It is essential to declare all your pre-existing diseases clearly in the proposal form while buying a health insurance policy. Inadequate information or non-disclosure of pre-existing diseases can lead to rejection of the claim and can lead to policy cancellation.

Considering the risks, alcohol consumers and smokers would need to undergo a stringent pre-medical examination and pay a higher premium to get health insurance coverage."
health_insurance,main,"Though most health insurance plans cover medical expenses for hospitalization of more than 24 hours, there are plans that do not have a cap on the duration of hospitalization. All insurers these days cover day care procedures, where hospitalization of at least 24 hours is not required. It includes cataract surgery, varicose veins surgery and similar medical procedures. Moreover, several health plans now cover OPD treatments that do not require hospitalization at all."
health_insurance,main,"Most people rely on the health insurance plan provided by their employer. It is important to know that a group health insurance policy comes with a set of limitations. It will not offer coverage to all your family members in most cases, the sum insured will not be sufficient, or it will not cover critical illnesses. The coverage will cease to exist as soon as you quit your job. Getting health insurance coverage after retirement or quitting your job can be a difficult and expensive affair."
health_insurance,main,"In order to keep the policy in force, regular payment of a fixed premium amount is essential.Did you ever think about how this premium is calculated?There are certain factors that affect health insurance premiums, such as your age, the medical background of your family, sum insured, cumulative bonus, your personal medical history and so on."

health_insurance,critical_illness,"Critical illness insurance covers serious lifestyle diseases that can be life-threatening and require expensive and long-term medical treatment.It helps the policyholder to pay for the exorbitant cost of treating these critical ailments. While most health insurance plans provide critical illness as an optional cover/rider on payment of additional premium, others offer it as an in-built benefit."

health_insurance,critical_illness,"A Critical Illness Insurance policy covers the insured against life-threatening critical diseases, such as cancer, heart attack, renal failure, stroke, etc. This critical illness policy provides a lump sum coverage amount to the insured on the first diagnosis of a listed critical illness that can be used to cover exorbitant treatment expenses. However, all critical illness insurance plans come with a waiting period of 90 days."

health_insurance,critical_illness,Take a look at some of the key benefits of buying a critical illness insurance plan:
health_insurance,critical_illness,"Regularmediclaim insuranceplans cover critical diseases to the extent of hospitalization expenses only. They reimburse the expenses incurred on treating a critical illness during hospitalization. However, critical illness insurance plans provide a lump sum amount upon diagnosis of covered critical illnesses that can be used to pay for healthcare expenses with or without hospitalization."
health_insurance,critical_illness,
health_insurance,critical_illness,
health_insurance,critical_illness,"Patients diagnosed with a critical illness cannot earn as they used to due to the physical limitations of going to work every day. On top of that, there will be a huge burden of medical expenses incurred on the treatment of the disease. Buying a critical illness insurance policy is a foolproof way of securing the entire family’s future against critical illnesses, as the lump sum claim amount can be used not only to pay medical bills and day-to-day home expenses."
health_insurance,critical_illness,"With hospitals spending heavily on super-speciality equipment, the treatment is getting better day-by-day. Combined with medical inflation, it increases the cost of medical treatment, especially during hospitalization."
health_insurance,critical_illness,"For example, women with breast cancer require Herceptin (breast cancer drug), which can cost anywhere between ₹15,000 to ₹54,000 per vial. While undergoing the treatment, the patient needs at least 16 vials. As a result, patients can end up spending ₹2.5 lakh to ₹8.6 lakh on medication during the treatment."
health_insurance,critical_illness,"Considering these high treatment expenses, opting for a good critical illness insurance plan seems to be a viable option."

health_insurance,critical_illness,"The need for a critical illness policy nowadays is more than ever. The sedentary lifestyle of the 21st century is giving rise to all kinds of illnesses, most of which are critical in nature. While the number of people developing/ contracting critical illness is increasing, the age at which people develop critical illnesses is consistently decreasing. This means that millennials are prone to developing critical illnesses as compared to the earlier generations. By buying a critical illness policy at an early age, young adults can safeguard themselves against the financial implications of these diseases while affording the best available treatment."
health_insurance,critical_illness,"The policyholder can avail tax benefits of up to ₹25,000 on critical illness insurance premiums under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Senior citizens can avail tax benefits of up to ₹50,000 under the same section."
health_insurance,critical_illness,*Tax benefits are subject to changes in tax laws.
health_insurance,critical_illness,"Everyone can benefit from a critical illness policy. However, the following people must buy a critical illness insurance policy:"
health_insurance,critical_illness,"Many critical illnesses are hereditary in nature, i.e., they run in families. A person is at a much higher risk of developing a critical illness if there is a family history of the same. Therefore, people with a history of critical illness in their family should definitely opt for a critical illness insurance policy."
health_insurance,critical_illness,"The role and importance of the primary breadwinner of a family are paramount. If something happens to them, the family’s financial future will be severely affected. The family may even have to face unpleasant financial situations. That’s why earning members of a family must buy a critical illness insurance cover, especially if they have a medical history."
health_insurance,critical_illness,"Critical illnesses are highly correlated with high-pressure jobs. Various studies indicate that people working in high-pressure work environments are at increased risk of developing a critical illness due to high stress levels. Therefore, employees who have a job that puts high pressure on them should definitely opt for a critical illness policy."
health_insurance,critical_illness,"People over the age of 40 years are more susceptible to developing critical illnesses than those younger than them. Thus, it is advised that they buy a critical illness insurance policy in their 30s, if not early. Moreover, they are likely to be in a better financial position and can pay policy premium easily at that age."

health_insurance,critical_illness,"Anyone and everyone stands to benefit from taking a critical illness policy. The modern-day hectic lifestyle is a harbinger of lifestyle-related illnesses, including critical illnesses like cancer, heart attack, stroke, etc. Not only do these diseases take a lot of time to treat, but they are also expensive."
health_insurance,critical_illness,"Moreover, getting diagnosed with a critical illness can reduce the ability of patients to earn. This is because the patient is often sick and home-bound. The reduced ability to work may lead to not being able to work at all, triggering a financial crisis."
health_insurance,critical_illness,Opting for a critical illness policy can help patients afford the best available treatment without exhausting their funds and offer a replacement for loss of income.
health_insurance,critical_illness,"When Neeraj was diagnosed with a brain tumour, he was completely shattered. His health insurance policy with a sum insured of ₹10 lakh took care of the incurred treatment expenses. However, the revenues of his business started falling down as he was unable to take care of his business due to the severity of his illness. As a result, the financial health of the business deteriorated (along with his health). If only he had a critical illness policy, he would have taken care of his treatment expenses as well as his family's future after the fall of his business."
health_insurance,critical_illness,"Many people like Neeraj do not know that a health insurance policy is different from a critical illness insurance policy. To get a better understanding, check out the key differences between a critical illness insurance plan and a health insurance plan:"
health_insurance,critical_illness,
health_insurance,critical_illness,
health_insurance,critical_illness,Here are various factors to keep in mind before opting for a critical illness insurance plan:
health_insurance,critical_illness,The sum insured amount is essential to determine which policy works for you. Treatment for some critical illnesses costs comparatively less than others. Knowing how much coverage you want will help you choose the right plan for your needs. Compare different critical illness insurance plans to find the plan with a sum insured that works for your needs.
health_insurance,critical_illness,"Before buying a critical illness plan, it is essential to check the list of critical illnesses covered. Different plans provide coverage for a different number of critical illnesses. Make sure to opt for a plan that covers most of the common critical ailments for an affordable premium."
health_insurance,critical_illness,"All critical illness insurance policies come with a waiting period. This means that the policyholder can avail insurance coverage for covered critical illnesses after the end of the waiting period. Although most plans come with a waiting period of 90 days, some plans may ask you to wait for a shorter time. Therefore, insurance experts recommend opting for a critical illness insurance plan with a low waiting period."
health_insurance,critical_illness,"A standalone policy attracts a higher insurance premium as compared to a rider, offering comprehensive coverage. The scope of coverage offered by a standalone critical illness insurance plan is higher as compared to a rider. Although a rider may provide coverage for the same set of critical illnesses, the sum insured will be way less. This is because the rider is dependent on the base policy.For instance, if a mediclaim policy is for ₹2 lakh, then the critical illness rider will provide insurance coverage for ₹2 lakh only."
health_insurance,critical_illness,"To enjoy comprehensive insurance coverage, insurance experts recommend opting for a standalone critical illness plan."
health_insurance,critical_illness,"Most critical illness insurance plans come with a survival period of up to 30 days. It is a period that the insured needs to survive to get a claim from the insurance company. If the insured dies during the survival period, then no claim amount is paid by the insurer."
health_insurance,critical_illness,Checking the sub-limits under a critical illness insurance policy is important as they have repercussions on the costs you would have to bear. It indicates the limit to which the insurer will cover a critical illness. Sub-limits are applicable to the total sum insured under a critical illness plan.
health_insurance,critical_illness,"For instance, a critical illness insurance policy may cover Illness 1 for up to 100% of the sum insured and Illness 2 for up to 50% of the sum insured or ₹10 lakh. Thus, if you are diagnosed with Illness 2, you will have to pay for any expenses incurred above ₹10 lakh from your own pockets."
health_insurance,critical_illness,"Before purchasing a critical illness insurance policy, you should check the exact inclusions and exclusions in the policy document. It will help you get a better understanding of the plan, as coverage may vary from plan to plan."
health_insurance,critical_illness,"For instance, a critical illness insurance policy focusing more on cardiovascular diseases may have cataract surgery as an exclusion. Moreover,if you are looking for a specific set of illnesses to get insured against, make sure you check the details beforehand."
health_insurance,critical_illness,"Critical illness insurance policies catering to senior citizens offer wider coverage and attract a higher insurance premium. This is because senior citizens are at a higher risk of developing critical illnesses as compared to young adults. Therefore, buying a critical illness plan at an early age is recommended to keep your premiums low."
health_insurance,critical_illness,"Most critical illness insurance policies provide coverage to people between the ages of 18 and 65 years. However, some plans may provide coverage to children as well as senior citizens above 65 years. Therefore, you must check the exact entry age to know if you are eligible to buy the plan."
health_insurance,critical_illness,Follow the steps given below to file a critical illness insurance claim:
health_insurance,critical_illness,Step 1:Contact your insurance company as soon as you are diagnosed with a critical illness and register your claim.
health_insurance,critical_illness,Step 2:Submit the following documents to get your claim approved:
health_insurance,critical_illness,"Step 3:After receiving the documents, the claims team of the insurer will verify the details."
health_insurance,critical_illness,"Step 4:Based on the verification, your claim will be approved or disapproved. Whatever the case may be, you will be intimated of it."
health_insurance,critical_illness,"Step 5:Once your claim is approved, the insurer will transfer the claim amount to you."
health_insurance,critical_illness,Note:The insured may have to provide additional documents depending upon the claim.
