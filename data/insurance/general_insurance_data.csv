general_insurance,main,"The concept of insurance applies to a large group of people who may suffer from the same issue in the same region or condition. The money collected as the premium can be considered as a pool, and when someone encounters a loss, he/she is paid from this pool."
general_insurance,main,"Let’s understand what is a general insurance policy and how does it work with the following example. Suppose your family member suffered a heart attack, and they require a transplant on an immediate basis. At the same time, you have to pay the fees for your daughter's first year of college. Now, you have huge expenses to meet simultaneously, and both the issues have the same priority. In this stressful time, a health insurance policy for your family can share your burden by paying for the transplant, and you can pay the fees of your daughter from your savings without any worry. In this way, general insurance in India works as your saviour."
general_insurance,main,"Unlike life insurance policies, the tenure of general insurance policies is not that of a lifetime. Most general insurance products are annual contracts. Sometimes, the term lasts for the duration of a particular economic activity or a given period. However, a few products, like home insurance, have a longer term of up to 10 years."
general_insurance,main,"Suppose you are driving back home after completing a stressful day at work, and suddenly, another car hits your car from behind. Your car's bumper comes out, and it gets a dent. Now, you require approximately ₹7500 to fix the bumper and ₹2000 for dent repair. A car insurance plan will play a key role in such cases. The amount you have paid to repair your car can be reimbursed under a comprehensive car insurance policy. In this way, a general insurance policy for a car fulfils your requirement for financial help in case of car damage due to an accident."

A comprehensive policy even secures against damages caused by natural and manmade calamities, including acts of terrorism."
general_insurance,main,Motor insurance offers protection to the vehicle owner against:
general_insurance,main,"Motor insurance is mandatory in India as per the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and needs to be renewed every year. Driving a motor vehicle without insurance in a public place is a punishable offense."
general_insurance,main,"Third-party insurance is a statutory requirement in our country. Thus, the owner of the vehicle is legally liable for any injury or damage caused to a third party life or property by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place."
general_insurance,main,A comprehensive motor insurance policy would include a personal accident and liability only policy (third party insurance) in addition to own damage cover (damage to the owner's vehicle) in one policy.

general_insurance,main,"Healthcare costs are increasing every year. Sedentary lifestyles and stress at work negatively affect health and can result in a critical illness or medical emergency. Such a scenario is sure to adversely affect people financially, due to the massive medical expenditure. A health insurance policy is the only way to mitigate these financial risks, apart from leading a healthy lifestyle. Health insurance guarantees peace of mind in times of crisis and helps secure the health of policyholders and their families."

general_insurance,main,Home is often the most treasured possession of an individual and also the largest financial investment people make in life. Safeguarding the physical structure and contents of the home seems like a logical thing to do.
general_insurance,main,"Home insurance protects the house and/or its contents, depending on the scope of the insurance policy opted for. It secures the home against natural calamities and manmade disasters and threats. Home insurance protects against risks and damages from fire, burglary, theft, flood, earthquakes, etc., covering the physical asset (building structure) and valuables (contents) in it."
general_insurance,main,Home insurance ensures that people's hard-earned savings are utilized to meet important needs instead of using them for rebuilding the house if some harm was to come to it.
general_insurance,main,"Businesses involve the import and export of goods within national borders, and across international borders.

Marine cargo insurance offers complete financial protection during transit of goods and compensates in the event of any loss suffered."
general_insurance,main,"The party responsible for ensuring the goods are determined by the sales contract. Marine cargo insurance policy can be taken by buyers, sellers, import/export merchants, buying agents, contractors, banks, etc. This type of general insurance policy usually covers the cargo, but can also be extended to cover the interest of a third-party post transfer of ownership as determined by terms of sale."

general_insurance,main,The hull of a ship or boat can be insured under marinehull insurance.
general_insurance,main,Insurance solutions to meet the needs of agriculture and rural businesses form part of rural insurance. IRDAI has stipulated annual targets for insurers to provide insurance to the rural and social sectors.
general_insurance,main,"As per these regulations, insurers are required to meet year-wise targets:"
general_insurance,main,"As the name of this general insurance policy suggests, a mobile insurance plan safeguards a mobile phone from accidental damage. In the mobile insurance policy, the insurance company compensates for the repair of the mobile's screen damaged in an accident. Mobile buyers have the freedom to purchase a mobile insurance plan for both new and old mobiles. Mobile insurance is one of those types of general insurance in India that is very affordable as compared to expensive phones."
general_insurance,main,"Not just two-wheelers and cars, people these days are passionate about expensive bicycles as well. Call it a lifestyle change or fashion, but bicycles are another most wanted product today. Many insurance providers offer coverage for personal accidents, accidental damage, theft, and even hospitalization with a bicycle insurance policy."

This sharp increase follows the removal of steep discounts, some exceeding 95%, that were applied since May 2024, and an 80% rate hike on property insurance that took effect on January 1st. Reinsurers have flagged rising claim ratios, stressing that insurers must align premiums with actual risk exposure . Firms are now urged to bolster fire safety standards and reevaluate coverage to manage these higher costs."

general_insurance,home,Home Insurance: Why Coverage Should Include Calamities & Reconstruction Cost
general_insurance,home,"Experts advise that home insurance in India should go beyond theft or fire and cover natural calamities and full reconstruction costs. With more frequent extreme weather events, standard policies may fall short. A comprehensive policy ensures financial support to rebuild or repair after disasters. Many homeowners mistakenly focus only on the property’s market value. Choosing broader coverage is key to true protection."

general_insurance,home,"Home Insurance Essential Amid Rising Earthquakes, Floods, Fires, and Natural Disasters"
general_insurance,home,"With disasters like earthquakes and floods becoming increasingly frequent, home insurance is crucial for protecting your most valuable asset. Despite low premiums (starting at ₹2,500 annually), many Indians overlook this safeguard. Policies cover structural damage, contents, and even high-risk zones. From fire to landslides, comprehensive coverage ensures financial security. As Delhi’s recent quake shows, calamities strike unexpectedly, making home insurance not just wise, but essential."

general_insurance,home,"Less Than 1% Indian Homes Insured in Uttarkashi, Tragedy Sparks Concern"
general_insurance,home,"The recent Uttarkashi tunnel collapse has spotlighted India’s massive home insurance gap. According to Policybazaar, less than 1% of Indian households have home insurance, leaving millions vulnerable to natural disasters. Despite rising climate risks, awareness and adoption remain critically low. Experts urge homeowners to consider affordable coverage options to protect against property loss, especially in disaster-prone regions. The incident underscores the urgent need for broader insurance penetration."

general_insurance,home,"Tenants Not Covered by Landlord’s Insurance, Separate Policy May Be Essential"
general_insurance,home,"Many tenants mistakenly believe their landlord’s house insurance covers their belongings or liabilities. In reality, landlord insurance typically protects only the building and the owner’s assets. Tenants need separate renters or home content insurance to safeguard their possessions and personal liability. Without it, they risk financial loss in case of fire, theft, or accidents. Understanding this gap is crucial for renters seeking full protection and peace of mind."

general_insurance,home,Rising Risks Make Home Insurance a Household Essential
general_insurance,home,"With extreme weather events, accidents, and thefts on the rise, financial experts are urging homeowners to consider home insurance as a vital safety net. A recent Outlook Money article highlights how such policies can cover hefty repair costs, loss of valuables, and even alternate accommodation. While many still overlook it, insurers say a small annual premium can prevent major financial setbacks. In uncertain times, protecting your home is no longer optional, it’s essential."
